# sql-challenge

This script first designs the tables to hold data in the CSVs, then imports the CSVs into a SQL database, and answers questions about the data. In other words, it performs:
1.	Data Modeling
2.	Data Engineering
3.	Data Analysis


Data Modeling
Inspects the CSVs and sketch out an ERD of the tables.

Data Engineering
•	Utilizing the information provided created a table schema for each of the six CSV files. Specified data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.
•	Imported each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table.

•	The image is submitted as ERD image as a png file
